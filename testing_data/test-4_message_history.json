Our approach employs a multi-scale feature pyramid network to maximize detection accuracy across a range of object sizes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the COCO dataset, obtaining a mAP of 0.74, an improvement of 2.4% over the previous state of the art. Our method is efficient, achieving real-time speeds of 30 frames per second on a single GPU. We believe our approach has significant practical implications for real-world object detection scenarios."
